# Safe Stree

Violence and discrimination can blight women’s lives and hold them back from playing a full part in the workplace, society and the economy. Women and girls experience and fear different forms of sexual violence in public spaces, from unwelcome sexual remarks and gestures, to rape and femicide. It happens on streets, in and around public transportation, schools, workplaces, public toilets, water and food distribution sites, and parks.

We’re taking action to improve women’s rights and safety in the communities in which we operate. Safe Stree is a comprehensive solution to help women feel safer and inclusive. This tool helps women make informed decisions and travel independently while always having their near and dear ones behind their back.

No need to download any app just login to the site on the phone browser when on the go. It is quite lightweight,less battery intensive and caters even to women in rural areas where low end smartphones usually don’t have large storage space for apps. With various functionalities incorporated, this tool will drastically make women feel safer.
